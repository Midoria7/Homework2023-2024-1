## What is the Results Section?

+ The section of the research that reports your study's findings derived from the methods you have applied to gather and analyze information.
+ It states the findings of the study or research and presents them in a logical sequence without bias or interpretation from the author.

## Where does it go in the paper?

The results section is the **third** major section of most scientific papers. It follows the presentation of the **Methods and Materials** and comes before the **Discussion** section.

$\rightarrow$ What did you find in your results?

## What does the Results section include?

### Should Include

- Only the findings of your study
- Data presented in tables, charts, graphs, and other figures
- A contextual analysis of this data
- Explanation of data derived from previous studies (also found in the Discussion section)

**State only results that are MOST RELEVANT to research questions**

### Should NOT Include

- Information that does not present direct findings or outcome of the study
- Methods of analysis, background and interpretation of the results

## Structure of the Results Section

**Organize the results "Logically"**

- Within each research question, present the type of data that addresses that research question.
- Present the results that address this specific research question.
  - Positive survey responses using descriptive phrases
  - Frequency counts, subcategories, rich quotes, etc.
- Present a content analysis of another part of the spectrum of the same research question
  - Negative or neutral survey responses
  - Use defined terms or abbreviations to make descriptions more concise.
- Move onto another research question

## Tables and Figures

### How to Place Results and Add Captions

- Check the requirements and standards of the journal.
- Figures and explanations of results should be in the same order.
- To create a caption, change the research question into a phrase.
- Information should be clear and concise.

## Steps for Composing the Results

1. Consult the guidelines or instructions the target journal or publisher provides authors and read its articles.
2. Consider your research results in relation to the journal's requirements and catalogue your results.
   + Focus on results that are most relevant to your research objectives.
   + Catalogue your results and use **subheadings** to streamline and clarify your report.
   + Choose the structure of your results—determined by research questions or matching the order of the methods.
3. Design figures and tables to present and illustrate your data.
    + Number according to the order they are mentioned in the main text.
    + Should be self-explanatory and include definitions and other necessary information.
    + Use tables and figures as a focal point to tell a clear story about your research.
4. Draft your Results section using the findings and figures you have organized.
   + Restate research questions or aims in the opening paragraph; summarize key findings at the end.
   + Write in the past tense and the active voice.
   + Ensure that special terms or abbreviations used have been explained in the Introduction.
5. Review, edit, and revise your draft.
   + Double-check the accuracy and consistency of data and visual elements.
   + Read your draft aloud to catch language errors, awkward phrases, and missing transitions.
   + Ensure that results are presented in the best order focus on objectives and prepare readers for later interpretations, valuations, recommendations, etc.
   + Find additional readers to look over your work.(Wordvise)
