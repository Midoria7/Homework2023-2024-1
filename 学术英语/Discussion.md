## Function

1. Interpret results in light of what was already known and explain new understanding after your research.
    + Summarize the process, results, and overall purpose.
    + Discuss the results in order.
    + Provide general and secondary details.
2. Implications and Limitations—explain the importance of these findings to this field and the wider science.
    + Assess which results/methods were most useful.
    + Discuss which did not work or could be improved (limitations)
    + Compare/contrast results to other studies.
    + Discuss what this means to the area of research.
3. Suggest further research to expand or clarify this work.
    + Discuss other methods or designs that could confirm this work or answer related research questions.
4. Include a concluding paragraph.
    + Summarize the importance of the work and/or expand its impact. Really 'SELL' the importance of the work!

## Style and Content Tips

+ More similar to Introduction section.
+ Use the active voice as much as possible but some passive is ok if not wordy or awkward.
+ Some use of first-person is okay, but only if it is specific and clear.
+ Use past-tense when discussing results and methods, present tense when discussing the implications of the results.

## Structure

1. Interpreting the results
   - Begin with a subheading and/or introductory sentence
   - Present interpretation in the order presented in the Results.
   - Start with interpretation of main findings and then details.
   - Do not RESTATE the results—use "bridge sentences" to relate results to interpretation.
2. Use a **bridge sentence** to relate the result to the interpretation.
    + **Useful verbs/verb phrases:** suggest, imply, entail, establish, mean that, is more relevant, reveal, create
    + **Useful objects:** a connection/relationship between, a disparity, A is greater than B, a reduction/increase in X
3. Modal verbs are often used.
   + Clearly signal these limitations.
   + Indicate conditional situations.
4. A conclusion can do one or more of the following
   - Briefly show how your work advances the field from the present state of knowledge.
   - Indicate extensions and further implications.
   - Suggest future studies/experiments and point out any work that is currently ongoing.
   - Extend your research claims and questions.
5. Modal verbs limit the sharpness of your resaerch implications.
