## Formatting Style

(From ChatGPT)

APA, AMA, and MLA refer to different styles of academic citation and formatting:

1. **APA (American Psychological Association):** This format is widely used in the social sciences. It emphasizes the date of publication and the author's name in its citation style. The APA format is commonly used for writing and formatting research papers, particularly within the fields of psychology, education, and other social sciences.

2. **AMA (American Medical Association):** This citation style is predominantly used in the medical and scientific communities. The AMA format places more emphasis on the citation of journals and books and is particularly adhered to in medical research papers and journals.

3. **MLA (Modern Language Association):** This style is typically used in the humanities, especially in English literature, languages, and other areas of the humanities. MLA format focuses on the author and the page number in the citation and is often used for literary research, as well as academic papers in the humanities. 

Each of these styles has its own specific rules for formatting, citing sources, and structuring documents, making them distinct from one another and suited to the specific needs of different academic disciplines.
